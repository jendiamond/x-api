    "workflow": "## Running Tests\nAll tests have been ignored except the first one for you to work on. To continue, just remove the ```[Ignore]``` attribute on the test to start working on it.\n\nMake sure [NUnit](http://nunit.org/?p=download) is installed, if not already installed from the setup from above.\n\nThis installation should include the NUnit-Gui executable. Run this and, after compiling, open the assembly from the Gui and you are able to run the tests.\n\n**Note:** You may need to include the nunit-framework.dll in the same directory as the source code you're compiling if you get an error saying it can't find the ```nunit.framework.dll```.\n\nIf you installed the NUnit runner through NuGet, the runner will be located in the ```\\packages\\NUnit.Runners(version number)\\tools``` folder where your project is.\n\nIf you installed NUnit manually the runner will be in the ```Program Files (x86)\\NUnit(version number)\\bin``` folder.\n\n![NUnit Runner](/img/nUnitRunner.png)\n\nOnce you have been able to compile the code it will create a DLL in the ```\\bin\\Debug``` folder of your project. In the NUnit runner, select \"Open Project\" and select the DLL that was created from compiling. This will load all the tests and allow you to run them.\n\n![NUnit Runner Execute Tests](/img/nUnitExecuteTests.png)\n\nThe NUnit runner will automatically reload the DLL if it has been updated.\n",
    "resources": "## Recommended Learning Resources\n\nExercism provides exercises and feedback but can be difficult to jump into for those learning C# for the first time. These resources can help you get started:\n\n* [Channel9 Series: C# Fundamentals](http://channel9.msdn.com/Series/C-Sharp-Fundamentals-Development-for-Absolute-Beginners)\n* [MSDN Walkthrough: Getting Started with C#](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/vstudio/dd492171(v=vs.120))\n* [.NET Framework Development Guide](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/vstudio/hh156542)\n* [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/)\n  * [C#](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/c%23)\n  * [.NET](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/.net)\n  * [NUnit](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/nunit)\n",
    "installation": "## Installing C&#35;\n\n### Windows\nThere are a couple of different ways to get started using C#. The main way is to\ninstall Visual Studio, the IDE for C# and related projects.\n\nIf you don't want to use the IDE, files can be compiled via command line using the\ncompiler provided by the .NET framework.\n\n#### With Visual Studio\n\nInstall [Visual Studio Express 2013 for Windows Desktop](http://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/download-visual-studio-vs#d-express-windows-desktop). This will include the IDE and compiler for C#.\n\nYou can either start by creating your own project for working with the Exercism problems or you can download a Visual Studio solution that is already set up.\n\n#### Exercism.io Visual Studio Template\n\nThis is a Visual Studio template that comes pre-configured to work on the problems in as many languages as Visual Studio supports.\n\n![Solution Explorer](/img/SolutionExplorer.png)\n\n1. Download the [Exercism.io Visual Studio Template](https://github.com/rprouse/Exercism.VisualStudio) from GitHub by clicking the Download Zip button on the page.\n2. Unzip the template into your exercises directory, for example `C:\\src\\exercises`\n2. Install the [Exercism CLI](http://help.exercism.io/installing-the-cli.html)\n3. Open a command prompt to your exercise directory\n4. Add your API key to exercism `exercism configure --key=YOUR_API_KEY`\n5. Configure your source directory in exercism `exercism configure --dir=C:\\src\\exercises`\n6. [Fetch your first exercise](http://help.exercism.io/fetching-exercises.html) `exercism fetch csharp`\n7. Open the Exercism solution in Visual Studio\n8. Expand the Exercism.csharp project\n9. Click on **Show All Files** in Solution Explorer (See below)\n10. The exercise you just fetched will appear greyed out. Right click on the folder and **Include In Project**\n11. Get coding...\n\n![Add files](/img/AddFiles.png)\n\nThe NUnit NuGet package is included in the project, so you will not need to install it.\n\nIf you have a paid version of Visual Studio install the [NUnit Visual Studio Test Adapter](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/6ab922d0-21c0-4f06-ab5f-4ecd1fe7175d). This will allow you to run the tests from within Visual Studio. If you have ReSharper installed, you can also [run the tests using ReSharper](https://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/features/unit_testing.html).\n\n![Test Explorer](/img/TestExplorer.png)\n\nIf you are using Visual Studio Express, install [NUnit 2.6.3](http://www.nunit.org/) and run the tests from the command line (see below).\n\n#### Create a New Visual Studio Project\n\nOnce installed and started, click on \"Create New Project\" (alternatively, you can go to File->New->New Project).\n\n![New Project](/img/newProject.png)\n\nChoose what language and project type (Visual C# and Class Library). Also name your project to whatever you'd like.\n\n![Create Project](/img/createNewProject.png)\n\nOnce created, feel free to drag and drop the C# Exercism folders into the project.\n\n![Drag and Drop Folders](/img/dragDropFolders.png)\n\nIn order to compile, get the [NUnit](http://nunit.org/) assembly referenced for the unit tests. This can be done via [NuGet](http://www.nuget.org/) - a package manager for Visual Studio. The best packages is to get the base [NUnit]() and the [NUnit.Runners](https://www.nuget.org/packages/NUnit.Runners/)\npackage since it includes the assemblies needed and a GUI test runner.\n\n![Nuget](/img/nugetMenu.png)\n\nTwo options to use Nuget - the NuGet manager or through the Package Manager Console.\n\nThe manager is the easiest way to get started.\n\n![Nuget Manager](/img/nugetManageNunitRunner.png)\n\nThe project should now be able to compile.\n\nTo start implementing the exercise, in Visual Studio, right click on where you want the file to go to and go to `Add` -> `Class`. Name it what you'd like.\n\n![New Item](/img/addNewClass.png)\n\nNow you can start coding!\n\n#### With the command line compiler\nThe .cs files can also be compiled without Visual Studio. Get the latest version of\n[.NET installed](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/5a4x27ek(v=vs.110).aspx) and there will be an executable called csc.exe.\n\nThe compiler executable is usually located in the Microsoft.NET\\Framework\\Version folder under the Windows directory.\n\nRefer to this [MSDN article](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/78f4aasd.aspx) for more information on the command line compiler.\n\n### Mac\nInstall [Mono Develop](http://www.mono-project.com/Mono:OSX#Installing_Mono_on_MacOS_X).\n\nBuild\n```bash\ndmcs Leap.cs LeapTest.cs -reference:nunit.framework.dll\n```\n\nLink\n```bash\nmonolinker -a /../NUnit-2.6.3/bin/nunit.framework.dll -a Leap.dll\n```\n\nAnd run the DLL\n```bash\nmono /../NUnit-2.6.3/bin/nunit-console.exe output/Leap.dll\n```\n\nClean up afterwards, if needed.\n```bash\nrm -rf output\n```\n\nMono does have an IDE that can be used for development instead of the above command line commands.\n\n### Linux\n\n[Mono Develop](http://www.mono-project.com/Mono_For_Linux_Developers) is also available for Linux.\n",
    "tools": "## Code Analysis\nCode Analysis can be turned on to run after a build of certain projects. This [MSDN article](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms182066.aspx) is a good walkthrough on how to enable code analysis.\n\n**NOTE:** This will add a bit of extra time to compile the project.\n\nCode A uses FxCop to run the analysis. [FxCop](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=6544) can be run separately as a stand alone program.\n\n[StyleCop](https://stylecop.codeplex.com/) can be installed and run inside Visual Studio to analyze the code style.\n"
